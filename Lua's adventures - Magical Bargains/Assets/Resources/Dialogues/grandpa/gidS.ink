avô Pedro: Alright, we’ll be starting a bit earlier today, but remember that time is money... so keep an eye on the clock!
avô Pedro: Trust your intuition to work a little faster and save some precious time.
avô Pedro: Oh, and please, avoid buying anything that looks haunted! I really don’t want to call an exorcist, they charge sooo much money !
avô Pedro: Ok, I’m counting on you now. Good luck!
