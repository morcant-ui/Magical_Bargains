av么 Pedro: So we'll be starting a little earlier today, but please don't forget that time is money !!
av么 Pedro: let your intuition guide you a little in order to save time !
av么 Pedro: Also pleaaase don't buy stuff that look haunted or something, I don't want to have to call an exorcist, they charge sooo much money !
av么 Pedro: Ok I'll leave it to you now, good luck :-)
