Grandpa: So we'll be starting a little earlier today, but please don't forget that time is money !!
Grandpa: let your intuition guide you a little in order to save time !
Grandpa: Also pleaaase don't buy stuff that look haunted or something, I don't want to have to call an exorcist, they charge sooo much money !
Grandpa: Ok I'll leave it to you now, good luck :-)
