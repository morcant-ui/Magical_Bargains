[First Grandpa dialogue]
So here we are young miss
Your job will be to tend to this pawn shop for magical artifacts
Clients will come in and present items that they want to part with
You will need to appraise the item and bargain with the client for a good price
I will be selling the newly acquired items tonight so please don't buy too much junk !
I'll help you for the first client. Look, they're coming in already, 
let's see what they have !
