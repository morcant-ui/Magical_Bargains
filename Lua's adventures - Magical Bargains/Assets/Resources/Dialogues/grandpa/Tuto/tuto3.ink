Grandpa: You're gonna have 3 tools at your disposal, you can activate them with the buttons to your right:
Grandpa: We have a magical thermometer to gauge the concentration of magic inside the object. The STRONGER the color, the more POWERFUL the magic is !
Grandpa: Remember you have to shake the tool EVERYTIME you use it, like real thermometers ! 
Grandpa: Keep left click pressed on the thermometer to shake it, release to see what kind of magic resides in this artifact.
Grandpa: There's a magical scanner to reveal what you cannot see, like spirits that cling to the object, for example.
Grandpa: Wait until the lens is calibrated correctly, and right click when it seems right !
Grandpa: And finally, we have a magnifier to check if the object is not dirty or something..
Grandpa: this is just a regular magnifier, drag it over the object to see the object more closely.
Grandpa: You ought to be thorough ! 
Grandpa: Make sure the object is in good condition before buying, ok ?
