avô Pedro: Okay, looks like this one came in with a pretty expensive item!
avô Pedro: Don’t worry though, lots of clients will pass through each day.
avô Pedro: Well, maybe not today... we started a bit late, so there’s not much time left. Haha!
avô Pedro: This client was in a hurry, so you didn’t get to bargain much...
avô Pedro: But from now on, you’ll be able to negotiate! Try raising your offer or pointing out flaws in their items, that might earn you a nice discount!
avô Pedro: I’ll leave you with the next clients, okay? I know it’s all new, but you’re a smart kid! You’ll get the hang of it, one step at a time.
avô Pedro: Alright, I’m off to bed. I’ll wake up tonight when it’s time to sell what you’ve bought!
avô Pedro: Bis bald and good luck!
