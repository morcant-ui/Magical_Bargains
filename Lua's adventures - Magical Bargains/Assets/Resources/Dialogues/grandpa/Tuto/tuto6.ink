avô Pedro: Okk so they may have come with a object too expensive !
avô Pedro: Don't be discouraged, a lot of client comes in a day
avô Pedro: Well, for today we started a little late so there's not much time left haha
avô Pedro: I will leave you with the next clients ok ? I know this is all new to you, but you're a smart kid, I'm sure you'll figure out everything on your own one step at a time :-)
avô Pedro: Ok i'll go to sleep now and wake tonight when it's time to sell what you bought !
avô Pedro: Bis bald and good luck :-)
