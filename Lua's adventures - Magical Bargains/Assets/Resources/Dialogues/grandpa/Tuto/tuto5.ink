avô Pedro: Now that you have inspected their artifact, let's see the client's price.
avô Pedro: If you feel like their object is not worth the amount that the client ask for, feel free to adjust your offer using the white buttons on your desk !
avô Pedro: Be careful however, because the client might refuse your counter offer, don't be too sad if that happens !
avô Pedro: You also need to make sure that you have enough money to buy the artifact: you'll find a BLUE bubble to your top right and it will display how much cash you have left.
avô Pedro: Otherwise, if it seems that their trying to sell you junk, feel free to refuse to buy from them !
avô Pedro: Ok, now. Let's hear how much the client ask for :-)
