avô Pedro: This camera acts as a magical scanner to reveal what you cannot see, like spirits that cling to the object, for example.
avô Pedro: It works like a regular camera, but first, you need to calibrate the lens.
avô Pedro: To calibrate, watch the lens carefully and press RIGHT CLICK when the calibration looks right.
avô Pedro: After that, the camera will take a picture, and you’ll need to study the image closely to spot hidden details.
avô Pedro: I’ll leave it to your good judgment to decide if the spirits feel good or bad. Please don’t buy anything haunted! It could mess up my whole inventory!
