avô Pedro: This thermometer detects magic inside objects! The BRIGHTER and more intense the color, the more POWERFUL the magic.
avô Pedro: You must SHAKE it every time, like old mercury thermometers, you still know these?
avô Pedro: To shake, hold LEFT CLICK on the thermometer until it starts shaking. Then RELEASE to see the magic level.
avô Pedro: It takes some practice to understand what intensity mean good magic. Don’t worry though, you’ll get the hang of it with time!
